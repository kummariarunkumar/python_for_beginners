a=[8,3,5,6,1,2,7,11,9]
print(a[-1:-4])


'''
The print statement `print(a[-1:-4])` in Python will not produce the output you might expect. In Python, when you use slicing with negative indices, the format is `a[start:stop]`, where `start` is inclusive and `stop` is exclusive. When `start` is a negative index and `stop` is a more negative index, the result is an empty list because slicing in Python moves from left to right.

Let's break down what `a[-1:-4]` means in this context:

- `a[-1]` refers to the last element in the list `a`, which is `9`.
- `a[-4]` refers to the fourth element from the end of the list, which is `2`.

However, when slicing, `a[-1:-4]` means starting at the element `9` and trying to move left to the element `2`. Since slicing moves from left to right, this results in an empty list because it cannot move right from `9` to `2`.

To get the elements from the end of the list, you should use:


print(a[-1:-4:-1])


Here, `-1` is the step argument which means "move from right to left." This will output the sublist `[9, 11, 7]` which is the last element moving backwards three steps.

So, the correct way to print the desired slice would be:

'''
a = [8, 3, 5, 6, 1, 2, 7, 11, 9]
print(a[-1:-4:-1])
'''

This will output:

[9, 11, 7]
