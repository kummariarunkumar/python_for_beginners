Let's analyze the code:

1. `a` is initialized to 8.
2. A `for` loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = 5` (a total of 6 iterations).
3. Inside the loop, `a` is multiplied by 1 in each iteration (`a *= 1`).

Since multiplying any number by 1 does not change its value, `a` remains 8 throughout the loop.

Therefore, after the loop completes, the value of `a` is still 8. The code will print `8`.
