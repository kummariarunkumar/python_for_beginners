Let's analyze the given code step by step:

1. `a` is initialized to 0.
2. A for loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = 4` (a total of 5 iterations).
3. In each iteration, `a` is incremented by 1.
4. If `i` is not equal to 3, the loop breaks (terminates).

Here's how the loop executes:

- **First iteration (`i = 0`)**:
  - `a` is incremented by 1, so `a` becomes 1.
  - Since `i` (0) is not equal to 3, the `if` condition is true, and the loop breaks immediately.

The loop breaks after the first iteration, so the value of `a` is 1.

Thus, the code prints `1`.
